// forwarder-plus-overload approach of #81 cannot be applied to them:
//
//   - Emitting both members as virtual lets a derived class the aspect cannot see override only the original
//     signature; calling the token-taking overload would then run the base body and ignore the override, silently.
//   - Emitting only the token-taking overload as virtual would break an existing 'override M()' with CS0506.
